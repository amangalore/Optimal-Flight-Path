This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Aman Mangalore (aamangal@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Rajvee Tibrewala (ratibrew@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Aman Mangalore spent       7 hours working alone.
Rajvee Tibrewala spent 		6 hours working alone.
We spent              		22 hours working together.
Aman Mangalore spent       11 hours driving.
Rajvee Tibrewala spent 		11 hours driving.
